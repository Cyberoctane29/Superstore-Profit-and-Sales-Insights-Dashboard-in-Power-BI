# Superstore Profit and Sales Insights Dashboard in Power BI
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Superstore sales and profitability. By combining KPI tracking, time-series trends, and comparative analysis across categories, regions, and segments, the report provides a holistic view of business performance. Advanced features such as drill-through navigation, dynamic titles, Top/Bottom N state analysis, bookmarks, and one-click slicer reset enhance interactivity and usability. Designed with a clean and minimalistic, pastel-blue layout and whitespace-oriented visuals, the dashboard delivers clear, actionable insights through modern data storytelling.
